# About me


I am currently a PhD student at Institute of Mathematics, EPFL, under supervision of [Daniel Kressner](https://people.epfl.ch/daniel.kressner?lang=en). I previously obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from School of Mathematics, Fudan University, in 2020 and 2023, respectively, where I was supervised by [Wenbin Chen](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/fa/5c/c30607a326236/page.htm).

My research focuses on numerical analysis, with emphasis on eigenvalue problems. My recent research interests include:

* Randomized techniques in large-scale eigenvalue problems.
* Analysis of first-order preconditioned eigensolvers.
